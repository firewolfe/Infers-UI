# Infers-UI
This is my Wotlk 3.3.5a version Unit Interface, made with help of various addons , & attention this UI is CPU hungry , use only if u have good processor :)
So there is some stuff to be done before U can have visuals in game
in WTF folder ,rename the folders to ur ones and i have renamed them as well which folders u have to rename (e.g rename account name ) stuff like that.
also this UI is 1080p resolution , u can edit if u wanna lower the frames , i will write up shortkeys for addons below ,so u can edit easy.
/suf - for shadowedunit frames
/tmw - tellmewhen
/wa - weakaura
/bt4 - bartender
other addons can be accessed through menus of addons too
